    Gather information when approaching at the forecourt

    This request will:
* Return a list of paymentMethods of the user which can be used at the
  gas station.
* Return up-to-date price information (price structure) at the gas
  station.
* Return a list of pumps available at the gas station together with the
  current status (free, inUse, readyToPay, outOfOrder). No pumps might
  be returned if the list of payment methods is empty.
* Create payment tokens for the paymentMethods of the user that are also
  supported at the gas station and pre-authorize the calculated maximum
  amount of money (background task).
The approaching is a necessary first api call for connected fueling. Without a valid approaching the [get pump](#operation/GetPump) and [wait for status change](#operation/WaitOnPumpStatusChange) calls may be answered with a `403 Forbidden` status code. An approaching is valid for one fueling only and can't be reused. If a long (not further disclosed time) has passed, the approaching is also invalidated. So if the client is receiving a `403 Forbidden` on the above mentioned calls, a new approaching has to be issued, this can be done transparent to the user.
