    which HTTP authentication schemes are supported.  If the

    request header field, the authorization server MUST
    respond with an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code and
    include the "WWW-Authenticate" response header field
    matching the authentication scheme used by the client.

    The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization
    code, resource owner credentials) or refresh token is
    invalid, expired, revoked, does not match the redirection
    URI used in the authorization request, or was issued to
    another client.

    The authenticated client is not authorized to use this
    authorization grant type.
    **unsupported_grant_type**
    The authorization grant type is not supported by the
