## Source code
The complete source code of the SDK can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/pace/cloud-sdk-ios).

## Specifications
**PACECloudSDK** currently supports iOS 11 and above.

It has some external dependencies which you will need to inlcude as well:

- [AppAuth](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS)
- [Base32](https://github.com/mattrubin/Bases)
- [OneTimePassword](https://github.com/mattrubin/OneTimePassword)
- [SwiftProtobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf)

## Installation
### Carthage
With [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add the following line to your Cartfile and run `carthage update --platform iOS`:
```
github "pace/cloud-sdk-ios" ~> 6.0
```
The integration of the SDK as `XCFramework` is currently not supported.

### Cocoapods
With [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html), add the following line to your `Podfile` to use the latest available version:
```
pod 'PACECloudSDK'
```

### Swift Package Manager (experimental)
With [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following dependency to your Package.swift:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(name: "PACECloudSDK", url: "https://github.com/pace/cloud-sdk-ios", .from(from: "6.0.0"))
]
```

### Binary
Each release has an `XCFramework` attached, which can be added to your application; see [releases](https://github.com/pace/cloud-sdk-ios/releases).

## Setup
The `PACECloudSDK` needs to be setup before any of its `Kits` can be used. Therefore you *must* call `PACECloudSDK.shared.setup(with: PACECloudSDK.Configuration)`. The best way to do this is inside
`applicationDidFinishLaunching` in your `AppDelegate`. It will automatically authorize your application with the provided api key.

`PACECloudSDK.Configuration` only has `apiKey` as a mandatory property, all other parameter either have a default value or are optional .

**Note**: `PACECloudSDK` is using the `.production` environment as default. In case you are still doing tests, you probably want to change it to `.sandbox` or `.stage`.

Available parameters:

```swift
apiKey: String
authenticationMode: AuthenticationMode // Default: .web
environment: Environment // Default: .production
isRedirectSchemeCheckEnabled: Bool // Default: true
domainACL: [String]? // Default: nil
allowedLowAccuracy: Double? // Default: nil
speedThreshold: Double? // Default: nil
geoAppsScope: String? // Default: nil
```

## Migration
### From 2.x.x to 3.x.x
In `3.0.0` we've introduced a universal setup method: `PACECloudSDK.shared.setup(with: PACECloudSDK.Configuration)` and removed the setup for `AppKit` and `POIKitManager`.

The `PACECloudSDK.Configuration` almost has the same signature as the previous `AppKit.AppKitConfiguration`, only the `theme` parameter has been removed, which is now defaulted to `.automatic`. In case you want to set a specific theme, you can set it via `AppKit`'s `theme` property: `AppKit.shared.theme`.

### From 3.x.x to 4.x.x
In `4.0.0` we've simplified the setup even further.

The `PACECloudSDK.Configuration` doesn't take an `initialAccessToken` anymore and will (as before) request the token when needed via the `tokenInvalid` callback (see [Native login](#native-login)).

Furthermore, the handling of the redirect scheme has been updated. The SDK automatically retrieves the URL scheme from your app's `Info.plist` (see [Deep Linking](#deep-linking)), therefore no `clientId` needs to be set within the `PACECloudSDK.shared.setup()` anymore.

The `PoiKitManager` has been removed as `PACECloudSDK`'s instance property. Instead it can be initialized directly via `POIKit.POIKitManager(environment:)`.

### From 4.x.x to 5.x.x
In `5.0.0` we've removed the option to pass a `force` parameter to the `IDKit.refreshSession(...)` call (see [Token refresh](#token-refresh)).

### From 5.x.x to 6.x.x
We've added more information in the `tokenInvalid` callback, thus the client can better react to the callback, i.e. a `reason` and the `oldToken` (if one has been passed before), will be included in the callback. Please refer to  [Native login](#native-login) for more information.

### From 6.x.x to 7.x.x
In version `7.x.x` we've made some big `AppKit` and `IDKit` changes.

- `AppKit`'s `invalidToken` callback has been replaced with a new `getAccessToken` callback. Please refer to [Native login](#native-login) for more information.
  + If you're **not** using `IDKit` this callback will be invoked and will have the same functionality as `invalidToken` before.
  + However if you **are** using and having set up `IDKit` the behavior now heavily changes:
    - `getAccessToken` will not be called anymore.
    - Instead `IDKit` first starts an attempt to refresh the session automatically.
    - If the session renewal fails there is a new `func didFailSessionRenewal(with error: IDKit.IDKitError?, _ completion: @escaping (String?) -> Void)` function that you may implement to specify your own behaviour for retrieving a new access token. This can be achieved by specifying an `IDKitDelegate` conformance and setting the `IDKit.delegate` property.
    -  If either this delegate method is not implemented or you didn't set the delegate property at all the SDK will automatically perform an authorization hence showing a sign in mask for the user
- The `IDKit` setup has been combined with the general SDK setup. 
  + `IDKit.setup(...)` is no longer accessible.
  + By adding the keys `OIDConfigurationClientID` and `OIDConfigurationRedirectURI` with non-empty values to your Info.plist `IDKit` will be initiated with the default PACE OID configuration. Please head over to [IDKit setup](#setup-1) to learn how to set up this functionality.
  + A custom OID configuration can still be passed to the `PACECloudSDK.Configuration` if desired.
- `resetAccessToken()` has been removed from the `PACECloudSDK.shared` proprety. This functionality is simply no longer needed.  
- `IDKit.OIDConfiguration`'s property `redirectUrl` has been renamed to `redirectUri`.
- `IDKit.swapPresentingViewController(...)` has been removed. The presenting view controller for the sign in mask now needs to be set directy via `IDKit.presentingViewController`.

#### Noteworthy changes
- If using IDKit it is no longer required to set the `Authorization` header for any requests performed by the SDK. It will be included automatically.
- A new `logout` callback has been added to `AppKitDelegate`
- All APIs used by the SDK have been updated. Previously included enums have been removed. The corresponding properties that were of type of those enums are now directly of type of their former raw representable.

## IDKit
**IDKit** manages the OpenID (OID) authorization and the general session flow with its token handling via **PACE ID**.

### Setup
All that needs to be done to use `IDKit` is to specify the OID Configuration. If you want to use the PACE default configuration you'll at least have to add `OIDConfigurationRedirectURI` and `OIDConfigurationClientID` with non-empty values to your `Info.plist`. `OIDConfigurationIDPHint` is only needed if required in your specific situation.
```xml
<key>PACECloudSDKOIDConfigurationClientID</key>
<string>YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string>
<key>PACECloudSDKOIDConfigurationRedirectURI</key>
<string>YOUR_REDIRECT_URI</string>

<key>PACECloudSDKIDKitSetup</key>
<dict>
    <key>OIDConfigurationRedirectURI</key>
    <string>pace://cloud-sdk-example</string>
    <key>OIDConfigurationClientID</key>
    <string>cloud-sdk-example-app</string>
    <key>OIDConfigurationIDPHint</key>
    <string>OPTIONAL_IDP_HINT</string>
</dict>
```
In case you would like to use your own OID Configuration create it like so and pass it to the `PACECloudSDK.Configuration`:
```swift
let config = IDKit.OIDConfiguration(authorizationEndpoint: AUTH_ENDPOINT,
                                    tokenEndpoint: TOKEN_ENDPOINT,
                                    clientId: CLIENT_ID,
                                    redirectUrl: REDIRECT_URL,
                                    additionalParameters: [KEY: VALUE])

let config: PACECloudSDK.Configuration =
    .init(
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
        authenticationMode: .native,
        environment: ENV,
        customOIDConfiguration: config
    )

// Keep in mind to setup the 'PACECloudSDK' before setting any 'IDKit' properties
PACECloudSDK.shared.setup(with: config)

IDKit.presentingViewController = YOUR_VIEWCONTROLLER
IDKit.delegate = YOUR_DELEGATE

// In case you want to set additional properties to you OIDConfiguration after its initialization
IDKit.OIDConfiguration.appendAdditionalParameters([String: String])
```

### Authorization
To start the authorization process and to retrieve your access token simply call:
```swift
IDKit.authorize { accessToken, error in
    ...
}
```
*IDKit* will automatically try to refresh the previous session.
For all devices on iOS 12 and below a native permission prompt for the internally requested `ASWebAuthenticationSession` will be displayed to the user.

### Token refresh
If you prefer to refresh the access token of your current session manually call:
```swift
IDKit.refreshToken { accessToken, error in
    ...
}
```

### Session reset
Resetting the current session works as follows:
```swift
IDKit.resetSession()
```
A new authorization will be required afterwards.

### 2FA setup
In numerous cases a second authentication factor is required when using Connected Fueling, e.g. when authorizing a payment. Following are methods that can be used to setup biometric authentication on the user's device or setup an account PIN.

In order to prevent websites from accessing your TOTP secrets (used when biometric authentication is used), a domain access control list has to be passed to the `domainACL` property of the `Configuration` object in the [setup phase](#setup). If you're not using a custom PWA, then setting the `domainACL` to `"pace.cloud"` is enough.

#### Mail-OTP
For some of the below mentioned methods an OTP is needed, which can be requested to be sent to the user's email via

```swift
IDKit.sendMailOTP(completion: ((Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)? = nil)
```

#### Biometry
The `PACECloudSDK` provides the following methods to enable and disable biometric authentication:

* Check if biometric authentication has been enabled on the device

    ```swift
    IDKit.isBiometricAuthenticationEnabled()
    ```

* Enable biometric authentication with either PIN, password or OTP (see [OTP](#mail-otp)).  
_**NOTE:**_ Up until 5 minutes after a successful authorization you may enable biometry without having to pass any of the aforementioned credentials.

    ```swift
    IDKit.enableBiometricAuthentication(pin: String, completion: ((Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)?)
    IDKit.enableBiometricAuthentication(otp: String, completion: ((Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)?)
    IDKit.enableBiometricAuthentication(password: String, completion: ((Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)?)

    // After a successful authorization
    IDKit.enableBiometricAuthentication(completion: ((Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)?)
    ```

* Disable biometric authentication on the device:

    ```swift
    IDKit.disableBiometricAuthentication()
    ```

#### PIN
The `PACECloudSDK` provides the following methods to check and set the PIN:

* Check if the user PIN has been set

    ```swift
    IDKit.isPINSet(completion: @escaping (Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)
    ```

* Check if the user password has been set

    ```swift
    IDKit.isPasswordSet(completion: @escaping (Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)   ```

* Check if the user PIN or password has been set

    ```swift
    isPINOrPasswordSet(completion: @escaping (Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)
    ```

* Set the user PIN with biometry; only works, if biometry has been setup before

    ```swift
    IDKit.setPINWithBiometry(pin: String, completion: ((Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)? = nil)
    ```

* Set the user PIN and authorize with the user password

    ```swift
    IDKit.func setPIN(pin: String, password: String, completion: @escaping (Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)
    ```

* Set the user PIN and authorize with an OTP previously sent by mail (see [OTP](#mail-otp))

    ```swift
    IDKit.setPIN(pin: String, otp: String, completion: @escaping (Result<Bool, IDKitError>) -> Void)
    ```

## AppKit
### Main Features
- Check for available Apps at the current location
- Retrieve an App as UIViewController or WKWebView
- Retrieve an App as Drawer/Slider
- Payment Authentication

### Setup
Biometry is needed for 2FA during the payment process, thus make sure that `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` is correctly set in your target properties.

### Native login
You can use *AppKit* with your native login (given that your token has the necessary scopes) as well. In case of a native login,
it is crucial that you set the configuration during setup accordingly, i.e. setting the `authenticationMode` to `.native`.

There is a `AppKitDelegate` method that you will need to implement, i.e. `func getAccessToken(reason: AppKit.GetAccessTokenReason, oldToken: String?, completion: @escaping ((AppKit.GetAccessTokenResponse) -> Void))`,
which is triggered whenever your access token (or possible lack thereof) is invalid; possible reasons: it has expired, has missing scopes
or has been revoked. You are responsible for retrieving a valid access token and passing a `GetAccessTokenResponse` with the token and wether it is a initial token or not (defaults to `false`) to the `completion` block.
In case that you can't retrieve a new valid token, don't call the `completion` handler, otherwise you will most likely end up
in an endless loop. Make sure to clean up all the App related views as well.

**_NOTE:_** With SDK version `7.x.x` this callback will only be sent if you're not using `IDKit` (see [6.x.x -> 7.x.x](#from-6xx-to-7xx)).

Pseudocode of implementing the protocol method and passing the response to `AppKit`:

```swift
func getAccessToken(reason: AppKit.GetAccessTokenReason, oldToken: String?, completion: @escaping ((AppKit.GetAccessTokenResponse) -> Void)) {
    retrieveNewToken { newToken in
        let response = AppKit.GetAccessTokenResponse(accessToken: newToken)
        completion(response)
    }
}
```

The `GetAccessTokenReponse` struct:

```swift
struct GetAccessTokenResponse: Codable {
    let accessToken: String
    let isInitialToken: Bool
        
    public init(accessToken: String, isInitialToken: Bool = 
    public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws
}
```

### Deep Linking
Some of our services (e.g. the onboarding of `PayPal` payment methods) open the URL in the `SFSafariViewController` due to security reasons. After completion of the process the user is redirected back to the App web view via deep linking. 

**_NOTE:_** In case you're not using deep linking at all you may want to set `isRedirectSchemeCheckEnabled` to `false` in the configuration during the setup (see [Setup](#setup)) to prevent warning messages to be logged.

In order to set the redirect URL correctly and to ensure that the client app intercepts the deep link, the following requirements must be met:
- Specify the `pace.YOUR_CLIENT_ID` in the app target's custom URL scheme (please refer to [Apple's doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app) on how to set up the custom URL scheme).
- After successfully having set the scheme, your Info.plist should look as follows:
```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>YOUR_TARGET_NAME</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>pace.YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```
- In case that you're not using native development, you may also set the redirect scheme directly as shown below:
```swift
PACECloudSDK.shared.redirectScheme = "pace.YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
```

In your `AppDelegate`'s `application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool` you will have to catch the `redirect` host and call `AppKit.shared.handleRedirectURL` to handle the callback.

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    switch url.host {
    case "redirect":
    AppKit.shared.handleRedirectURL(url)
        return true

    default:
        return false
    }
}
```

### Theming
`AppKit` offers both a `.light` and `.dark` theme. The theme is set to `.automatic` by default, which then takes the system's appearance setting. In case you want to enforce either `.light` or `.dark` theme, you can set it via the public `theme` property: `AppKit.shared.theme`.

### AppKitDelegate
This protocol needs to be implemented in order to receive further information about your requests. It will also provide specific data that allows you to correctly display Apps.
- `didFail(with error: AppKit.AppError)`: Called everytime an error occured during requests
- `didReceiveAppDrawers(_ appDrawers: [AppKit.AppDrawer], _ appDatas: [AppKit.AppData])`: Called if one or more AppDrawers have been fetched successfully

### Requesting local Apps
You need to make sure your users allowed your application to use their location. *AppKit* requires the user's current location but will not request the permissions.
To request the check for available local Apps call `AppKit.shared.requestLocalApps()`. This function will start retrieving the user's current position and return
all available Apps as AppDrawers by asynchronously invoking `AppKitDelegate's` `didReceiveAppDrawers(_ appDrawers: [AppKit.AppDrawer], _ appDatas: [AppKit.AppData])` once for each request. Possible errors during the request will also be passed via the `AppKitDelegate`.
Because of the fact that AppDrawers are dependent on the user's position, it's necessary to call the mentioned method periodically to make sure that Apps
will stay up to date. If a request does not contain a currently presented App / AppDrawer it will be removed by *AppKit* automatically. This may happen if the user changes the position to where the previously fetched App is no longer available at.

_**NOTE:**_ If the user moves faster than the default value of 13 m/s (~50 km/h) the delegate method will not be called. A different speed threshold can be set during the setup (see [Setup](#setup-2)).

### Is POI in range?
To check if there is a App for the given POI ID at the current location, call `AppKit.shared.isPoiInRange(id: String, completion: @escaping ((Bool) -> Void))`.

_**NOTE:**_ If the user moves faster than the default value of 13 m/s (~50 km/h) this method will return `false`. A different speed threshold can be set during the setup (see [Setup](#setup-2)).

```swift
AppKit.shared.isPoiInRange(id: poiId) { found in
    NSLog("==== Found id in range: \(found)")
}
```

### AppWebView / AppViewController
*AppKit* provides a default WKWebView or UIViewController that contains the requested App. There are several methods to obtain this WebView or ViewController. You may either pass a `appUrl`, a `appUrl` with some `reference` (e.g. a gas station reference) or a `presetUrl` (see [Preset Urls](#preset-urls)).
```swift
let webView = AppKit.shared.appWebView(appUrl: "App_URL")
let viewController = AppKit.shared.appViewController(appUrl: "App_URL")
```

```swift
let webView = AppKit.shared.appWebView(appUrl: "App_URL", reference: "REFERENCE")
let viewController = AppKit.shared.appViewController(appUrl: "App_URL", reference: "REFERENCE")

// Example reference
// The reference starts with a specific namespace identifier followed by the gas station id in this case
// It has to conform to the URN format
let reference = "1a3b5c7d-1a3b-12a4-abcd-8c106b8360d3"
```

```swift
let webView = AppKit.shared.appWebView(presetUrl: .paceID)
let viewController = AppKit.shared.appViewController(presetUrl: .payment)
```

### AppDrawerContainer
Before being able to display AppDrawers you need an instance of `AppDrawerContainer`. Call `setupContainerView()` to setup the container. It will automatically resize itself based on the amount of available AppDrawers.

### AppDrawer
The `AppDrawer` is a view that functions as a preview for a local App. It has a **collapsed** and **expanded** state. Former shows an icon and expands by tapping. Latter additionally shows a title and subtitle and collapses by tapping the `x-Button`. Tapping the AppDrawer bar will open the corresponding fullscreen
App. The drawers need to be added to a `AppDrawerContainer` in order to work correctly by calling `appDrawerContainer.inject(YOUR_DRAWERS)`.

A AppDrawer and the eventually opened App will automatically remove themselves if the App is no longer available at the user's current position.

### Custom AppDrawer
The responsible class needs to conform to the `AppKitDelegate` and must be set as `AppKit`'s delegate: `AppKit.shared.delegate = self`.

In order to check if there are apps available in the current position call `AppKit.shared.requestLocalApps()`.

As defined in [AppKitDelegate](#appkitdelegate), there are some methods that need to be implemented in, i.e.
`didReceiveAppData(_ appData: [AppKit.AppData])` and
`didEscapeForecourt(_ appDatas: [AppKit.AppData])`.

Each `AppKit.AppData` then contains the information for one connected fueling available gas station.

### AppData
Properties:
- `appID: String`: App id
- `appApiUrl: String?`: Base api url
- `metadata: [AppKit.AppMetadata: AnyHashable]`: Contains metadata like the gas station reference
- `appManifest: AppManifest?`: Contains name, description and icons of the App

#### AppMetadata
Retrieve the gas station id:

```swift
let gasstationID = (appData.metadata[AppKit.AppMetadata.references] as! [String])?.first
```

#### AppManifest
Properties:
- `name`: App Name
- `description`: App description
- `icons`: Gas station icons in different sizes

##### AppIcon
`AppIcon` only contains the source string for the icon image. You will need to fetch it yourself.
To get the source url you need to combine `AppData.appApiUrl` and `AppIcon.source` with "/".

```swift
AppData.appApiUrl + "/" + AppIcon.source
```

### AppError
This enum will provide several error messages during App requests and overall processing to give you a better understanding on what went wrong.

Possible errors:
- `noLocationFound`: GPS is unavailable or inaccurate
- `locationNotAuthorized`: Missing location permission
- `couldNotFetchApp`: *AppKit* was unable to retrieve the App
- `failedRetrievingUrl`: The App url couldn't be loaded
- `fetchAlreadyRunning`: App fetch is currently running
- `paymentError`: The payment couldn't be processed
- `badRequest`: The request does not match the expected format
- `invalidURNFormat`: The passed POI reference value does not conform to our URN format
- `customURLSchemeNotSet`: The App tried to open an URL in `SFSafariViewController`, but deep linking has not been correctly configured

## Miscellaneous
### Preset Urls
`PACECloudSDK` provides preset URLs for the most common apps, such as `PACE ID`, `payment`, `transactions` and `fueling` based on the enviroment the SDK was initialized with. You may access these URLs via the enum `PACECloudSDK.URL`.
 
### Logging 
Besides the own logs of the SDK's kits an `AppWebView` also intercepts the logs of their loaded apps. You may retrieve all of the mentioned logs as shown in the following code example:
```swift
let loggingInterceptor: LoggingInterceptor = .init()
PACECloudSDK.shared.isLoggingEnabled = true // Defaults to `false`
PACECloudSDK.shared.loggingDelegate = loggingInterceptor
 
// Conforms to the SDK logging delegate
class LoggingInterceptor: PACECloudSDKLoggingDelegate {
    func didLog(_ log: String) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>
    Error "Failed to build module 'PACECloudSDK' from its module interface; the compiler that produced it may have used features that aren't supported by this compiler"
  </summary>

  Make sure that all dependencies mentioned in [specifications](#specifications) have been included and set to `Embed & Sign`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    What is the `PACECloudSlimSDK` target?
  </summary>

  The slimmed version doesn't use any external dependencies and can therefore not handle 2FA and the vector tile data. This reduces the size of the framework significantly and can therefore be used in situations where app size is critical, e.g. App Clips.
